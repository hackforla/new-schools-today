### Standardized contribution method
Open and read through the issue you will be tackling
- Make sure you understand it. If not, comment any questions or ask them on Slack
- Create a new branch on GitHub that describes what you will code
  - Use camelCase → first letter is lowercase, no spaces, the first letter of every word is capitalized
- Create the file
  - The name should correctly identify the code so that others can understand
    - Ex: If you are making a staff directory call it “staffDirectory.dart”
  - Make sure that it is in the right folder, make another one if absolutely needed with Josh, Ben, or Jason’s approval
    - Ex: Pages go in the pages file, components go in the components file
- Start coding
  - Using comments, write some pseudo code
  - Add to central router, make sure it correctly refers to what you are accomplishing and that it is unlike the other routers
  - Do not touch unrelated files
  - After every coding session, add a comment to the issue you are working on
  - Make sure code is clean and well formatted
- When you have finished coding, double check that there are no issues and that the app works without any new bugs
- Create a pull request on GitHub that includes:
  - A detailed summary of everything you did
  - The issue it fixes
- If it is returned, read the comments, fix them, and create a new pull request
- If the issue is then closed, ask which issue you will deal with next
